# My first web project
& Mike's Aerial Services project is Mike McCarty's creation from the NUCAMP full-stack bootcamp. It is a website designed to inform customers of the aerial services offered by Mike's Aerial Services company. The site will incorporate each of the technologies learned in the bootcamp.  The bootcamp started with a four week course with overviews of HTML, CSS, & Javascript.  The second course was 5 weeks of Bootstrap and launched this project.  The project is born from Mike's love of drones and will incorporate some of his videos photography from his favorite drone by DJI the Phantom 4 Pro V2.0.
